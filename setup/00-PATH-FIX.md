# PATH Configuration Fix

**Issue**: `~/work/scripts` folder not in PATH, so utility scripts unavailable.

## Quick Fix

```bash
# Reload shell configuration
source ~/.zshrc

# Verify ~/work/scripts is in PATH
echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n' | grep work/scripts

# If it shows /Users/yourname/work/scripts, you're good!
```

## Test It Works

```bash
# These commands should now work from anywhere:
wdu.sh
organize-screenshots.sh
video-to-audio.sh --help

# If they don't work, run:
which wdu.sh

# Should show: /Users/yourname/work/scripts/wdu.sh
```

## If Still Not Working

1. **Check paths.zsh**:
```bash
cat ~/.config/zsh/paths/paths.zsh | grep "work/scripts"
```

Should show:
```bash
add_to_path "$HOME/work/scripts"
```

2. **Reload shell**:
```bash
exec zsh
```

3. **Verify PATH**:
```bash
echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n' | nl | grep work
```

Should show both:
- `/Users/yourname/work/scripts`
- `/Users/yourname/work/bin`

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ Added `~/work/scripts` to PATH in `.config/zsh/paths/paths.zsh`
2. ✅ Replaced all symlinks with actual file copies
3. ✅ All scripts now self-contained (no dependency on "Mac OS install" folder)

## Scripts Available After Fix

All these commands work from anywhere:

```bash
# Utilities
wdu.sh                      # Visual disk usage
organize-screenshots.sh     # Screenshot organization
video-to-audio.sh          # Video to audio conversion

# System
fix-hostname.sh            # Fix macOS hostname
network-priority.sh        # Network priority management

# Development
sync-to-branches.sh        # Git branch synchronization
vault-backup.sh           # Bitwarden backup
llm-usage.sh              # LLM usage tracking

# NAS
mount-nas-volumes.scpt    # Mount NAS volumes
setup-nas-keychain.sh     # Setup NAS keychain
```

## You Can Now Delete "Mac OS install" Folder

Since all symlinks are replaced with copies:

```bash
# Verify no symlinks remain
ls -la ~/work/scripts/ | grep "^l"

# If empty (no symlinks), safe to delete "Mac OS install" folder
# rm -rf ~/work/"Mac OS install"
```
