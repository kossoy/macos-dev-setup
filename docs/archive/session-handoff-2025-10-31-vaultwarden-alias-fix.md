## üìã Session Overview

This session fixed two related issues:
1. **Duplicate vw-* aliases** pointing to old `~/bin/` location
2. **"read-only variable: status" errors** in vaultwarden-backup-monitor.zsh

**Root Cause:** During Option A migration (session 2025-10-31-master), vaultwarden scripts were moved from `~/bin/` to `~/work/scripts/`, but duplicate old aliases remained in the config file, and the script used `status` as a variable name which conflicts with zsh's built-in read-only `$status` variable.

---

## üîß Issue Details

### Issue 1: Alias Error
```bash
‚ùØ vw-monitor
zsh: no such file or directory: /Users/i065699/bin/vaultwarden-backup-monitor.zsh
```

**Cause:** Duplicate alias definitions in `config/zsh/config/aliases.zsh`:
- Correct aliases (lines 109-112): `$HOME/work/scripts/vaultwarden-*.zsh`
- Duplicate aliases (lines 162-163, 232-234): `$HOME/bin/vaultwarden-*.zsh` (old location)

The last definition wins in shell, so the old path was used.

### Issue 2: Script Errors
```bash
status_icon:1: read-only variable: status
generate_health_score:61: read-only variable: status
```

**Cause:** Script used `status` as local variable name in 3 places:
- `status_icon()` function (line 53)
- `check_bitwarden_cli()` function (line 281)
- `generate_health_score()` function (line 418)

**Why it's an error:** In zsh, `$status` is a **built-in read-only variable** that holds the exit code of the last command (like `$?` in bash). You cannot assign values to it.

---

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Removed Duplicate Aliases

**File:** `config/zsh/config/aliases.zsh`

**Changes:**
- Removed duplicate `vw-monitor` alias at line 162
- Removed duplicate `vw-preview` alias at line 163
- Removed duplicate `vw-backup`, `vw-monitor`, `vw-preview` aliases at lines 232-234

**Result:** Only correct aliases remain (lines 109-112) pointing to `$HOME/work/scripts/`

### Fix 2: Renamed Conflicting Variables

**File:** `scripts/vaultwarden-backup-monitor.zsh` (REPO VERSION - source of truth)

**Changes:**
1. Line 53: `local status="$1"` ‚Üí `local state="$1"`
2. Line 281: `local status=$(bw status ...)` ‚Üí `local bw_status=$(bw status ...)`
3. Line 418: `local status="EXCELLENT"` ‚Üí `local health_status="EXCELLENT"`

**Also fixed:** Updated corresponding references to new variable names

### Fix 3: Deployed to Working Location

**Action:** Copied fixed script from repo to deployed location:
```bash
cp scripts/vaultwarden-backup-monitor.zsh ~/work/scripts/vaultwarden-backup-monitor.zsh
chmod +x ~/work/scripts/vaultwarden-backup-monitor.zsh
```

### Fix 4: Updated Both Config Files

**Files fixed:**
- `config/zsh/config/aliases.zsh` (repo version)
- `~/.config/zsh/config/aliases.zsh` (deployed version)

Both now have only correct aliases without duplicates.

---

## üß™ Testing & Verification

### Test 1: Script Runs Without Errors
```bash
~/work/scripts/vaultwarden-backup-monitor.zsh 2>&1 | head -40
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ No "read-only variable: status" errors
**Output:** Clean health monitoring report with no errors

### Test 2: Alias Resolves Correctly
```bash
grep "^alias vw-" ~/.config/zsh/config/aliases.zsh
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Only 4 correct aliases remain:
```bash
alias vw-backup='$HOME/work/scripts/vaultwarden-backup.zsh'
alias vw-monitor='$HOME/work/scripts/vaultwarden-backup-monitor.zsh'
alias vw-preview='$HOME/work/scripts/vaultwarden-preview.zsh'
alias vw-setup='$HOME/work/scripts/vaultwarden-setup.zsh'
```

### Test 3: Script Functionality Verified
**Health Score:** 80/100 (GOOD)
- ‚úÖ Backup directory exists and accessible
- ‚úÖ Latest backup: 30m ago (FRESH)
- ‚úÖ Git repository configured
- ‚ö†Ô∏è LaunchAgent not loaded (expected - not part of this fix)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Encryption disabled (user preference)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Notes

### Ground Truth vs Deployed Files

**Important Understanding:**
- **Ground Truth:** `macos-dev-setup/scripts/` (in repository)
- **Deployed Location:** `~/work/scripts/` (working copy)
- **Deployment Process:** Bootstrap scripts copy from repo to `~/work/scripts/`

**Bootstrap Scripts That Deploy:**
1. `bootstrap.sh` (line 463): `cp -r "$SCRIPT_DIR/scripts/"* ~/work/scripts/`
2. `simple-bootstrap.sh` (lines 110-111): Copies `.sh` and `.zsh` files separately

**Critical Rule:** Always fix scripts in the **repo's `scripts/` directory first**, then deploy to `~/work/scripts/`. Never edit deployed files directly.

### Why This Approach?
- ‚úÖ Version control - All changes tracked in git
- ‚úÖ Reproducible - Bootstrap can redeploy clean copies
- ‚úÖ Shareable - Other users get correct versions
- ‚úÖ Maintainable - Single source of truth

## üîÑ For Next Session

### To Apply This Fix (User Instructions)
User needs to open a **new terminal window** or run:
```bash
exec zsh
```

Then test:
```bash
vw-monitor  # Should work without errors
```

### If User Reports Still Broken
1. Check if they reloaded shell: `exec zsh`
2. Verify deployed script: `ls -la ~/work/scripts/vaultwarden-backup-monitor.zsh`
3. Check alias definition: `type vw-monitor`
4. Test script directly: `~/work/scripts/vaultwarden-backup-monitor.zsh`

### Script Architecture Reference
- Vaultwarden backup system fully documented in `guides/vaultwarden-backup-index.md`
- LaunchAgent configuration: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.vaultwarden-backup.plist`
- Backup location: `~/backups/vaultwarden-backups/`
- All 4 vaultwarden scripts working correctly

## üéì Lessons Learned

1. **Duplicate aliases are silent killers** - Last definition wins, hard to debug
2. **Zsh reserved variables** - `status`, `errno`, `pipestatus` are read-only built-ins
3. **Always test the fix** - Script ran successfully without errors (Rule 7 followed!)
4. **Repo is source of truth** - Fix in repo first, then deploy
5. **Context preservation** - Connected this fix to previous Option A migration work
