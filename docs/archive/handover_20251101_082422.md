# Session Handover: wdu Home Directory Fix

**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Session Type:** Bug Fix
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - Fix implemented and tested
**Previous Handover:** `docs/archive/handover_20251031_130054.md`

---

## üéØ Session Overview

Fixed critical bug in `wdu` script where running it in home directory would hang indefinitely with a coprocess error, then hang during scan. Implemented solution that refuses to scan home directory and shows quick `du -sh` summary instead.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### 1. Fixed wdu Home Directory Hang (This Session)

**Problem 1:** `read -p` command causing coprocess error in zsh
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning: Scanning home directory can take several minutes due to Library/ caches
   Consider scanning specific directories instead: wdu ~/Documents, wdu ~/Downloads, etc.

main:read:52: -p: no coprocess
```

**Problem 2:** Even after fixing the error, scanning home directory still hung for 60+ seconds with no output, appearing frozen to users.

**Root Cause:**
- `read -p` doesn't work in zsh (requires coprocess)
- Home directory contains millions of files in Library/, caches, logs
- `du` scan takes several minutes with no progress feedback
- Users think it's frozen and kill the process

**Solution: Refuse to Scan Home Directory**

**Changed `scripts/wdu.sh:113-133`:**

Instead of warning then scanning anyway, now:
1. Detects if scanning home directory (`$full_path == $HOME`)
2. Refuses to scan entirely
3. Shows quick `du -sh` summary for common directories
4. Exits immediately without hanging
5. Guides user to scan specific directories

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Refuse to scan home directory (too slow due to Library/ caches)
if [[ "$full_path" == "$HOME" ]]; then
    echo ""
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Cannot scan home directory (too slow due to Library/ caches)"
    echo ""
    echo "Showing quick summary of common directories instead:"
    echo ""

    # Show quick du -sh for common directories
    local dirs=("Documents" "Downloads" "Desktop" "Pictures" "Movies" "Music" "work" "projects")
    for dir in "${dirs[@]}"; do
        if [[ -d "$HOME/$dir" ]]; then
            local size=$(command du -sh "$HOME/$dir" 2>/dev/null | awk '{print $1}')
            printf "  %-12s %s\n" "$size" "~/$dir"
        fi
    done

    echo ""
    echo "To analyze a specific directory, run: wdu ~/Documents (or any other path)"
    return 0
fi
```

**New Output When Running `wdu` in Home Directory:**
```
Analyzing: /Users/i065699

‚ö†Ô∏è  Cannot scan home directory (too slow due to Library/ caches)

Showing quick summary of common directories instead:

  1.0G         ~/Documents
  15G          ~/Downloads
  0B           ~/Desktop
  3.7G         ~/Pictures
  2.4G         ~/Movies
  267M         ~/Music
  16G          ~/work

To analyze a specific directory, run: wdu ~/Documents (or any other path)
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **No hang** - Completes in ~8 seconds
- ‚úÖ **No error** - Removed broken `read -p` command
- ‚úÖ **Useful output** - Shows sizes of common directories
- ‚úÖ **Clear guidance** - Tells user how to scan specific directories
- ‚úÖ **Fast** - Uses `du -sh` on specific dirs instead of recursive scan

**Verified:** ‚úÖ All tests passed (Rule 7 compliance)

**Test Results:**
1. **Home directory (~)** - ‚úÖ Completes in ~8 seconds, exit code 0
   - Shows quick summary
   - No hang, no errors

2. **Regular directory (macos-dev-setup/)** - ‚úÖ Works perfectly
   - Shows bar chart as expected
   - Fast completion

3. **Large directory (~/work, 16.5G)** - ‚úÖ Completes in ~35 seconds
   - Shows full bar chart
   - Scans all subdirectories properly

- Displays total storage of ALL items
- **Special handling for home directory:**
  - Detects `$full_path == $HOME`
  - Shows quick `du -sh` for common directories
  - Exits immediately without recursive scan
  - Guides user to scan specific paths

### Common Directories Checked (in order)
1. Documents
2. Downloads
3. Desktop
4. Pictures
5. Movies
6. Music
7. work
8. projects

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Project Rules

**MUST READ before starting ANY work:**

### üìú Rule 1: Context Preservation
- **Maintain context across ALL interactions**
- Reference previous decisions and implementations
- Connect new work to existing patterns
- If context lost ‚Üí acknowledge immediately and review

### üìÇ Rule 2: Documentation Management (UNBREAKABLE)
- **ALL .md files MUST be in `docs/` folder**
- **Exceptions:** Only `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` in root
- **Violation:** Fix immediately in same response
- **Structure:** `docs/{api,guides,archive,ideas,rules}/`

### ‚è±Ô∏è Rule 3: Long Running Commands
- Commands > 30s MUST have timeout
- Estimate duration before running
- Monitor progress every 10-30s
- Never leave user wondering

### üîÑ Rule 4: Incremental Progress
- Break work into small, verifiable steps
- Show progress with clear indicators (‚úÖ ‚ùå ‚è≥)
- Verify each step before proceeding

### üéØ Rule 5: Pattern Consistency
- Follow existing code patterns
- Use established conventions
- Match existing architecture

### üë§ Rule 6: User Experience First
- Clear and concise communication
- Explain "why" not just "what"
- Provide alternatives when blocked

### üß™ Rule 7: Bug Fix Verification (ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY)
- **NEVER claim fix works without running tests**
- **NEVER tell user to "try it" - YOU test first**
- **NEVER say "should work" - PROVE it works**
- Run automated tests, paste output, verify success

**Full Rules:** `.claude/prompts/project-rules.md` (273 lines)
**Permissions:** `.claude/settings.local.json`

## üí° Key Learnings This Session

### Rule 7 Enforcement
- **Never claim success without testing** - User correctly called out violation
- **Test to completion** - Not just "it started", but "it finished successfully"
- **Prove it works** - Show actual output, verify exit codes
- **No shortcuts** - Testing is mandatory, not optional

### Technical Insights
- **zsh vs bash differences** - `read -p` doesn't work in zsh (needs coprocess)
- **Home directory complexity** - Millions of files make scans impractical
- **Better UX** - Refusing to do slow operation is better than hanging
- **Quick alternatives** - `du -sh` on specific dirs is faster than recursive scan

### User Experience
- **Don't hang without feedback** - Users will kill the process
- **Provide quick alternatives** - Show useful info instead of doing slow operation
- **Clear guidance** - Tell users what to do instead
- **Exit cleanly** - Return 0, don't leave hanging processes
