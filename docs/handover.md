# Session Handoff: Clean Install Fixes & LaunchAgent Renaming

**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Session Type:** Bug Fixing & Repository Updates
**Status:** ✅ Complete - All changes committed and pushed

---

## 🎯 Session Overview

Fixed multiple issues discovered during clean macOS installation testing and renamed LaunchAgents from `com.user.*` to `com.befeast.*` for consistency.

---

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. Fixed wdu.sh Globbing Error
**Problem:** `main:56: no matches found: ./*` when running on empty directories

**Solution:** Added NULL_GLOB handling in wdu.sh:122-124
```zsh
setopt NULL_GLOB 2>/dev/null || true
set +o pipefail
du_numeric_output=$(command du -sk ./* ./.[!.]* 2>/dev/null | sort -rn | head -n "$list_length")
unsetopt NULL_GLOB 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Verified:** ✅ Works on empty directories (tested on ~/Desktop)

---

### 2. Added Missing NAS Scripts to Repository
**Problem:** NAS mount scripts existed on working machine but not in repository, causing clean installs to fail

**Files Added:**
- `scripts/mount-nas-volumes.sh` - Basic NAS volume mounting
- `scripts/mount-nas-volumes-with-retry.sh` - NAS mounting with network retry logic
- `scripts/nas-mount-control.sh` - LaunchAgent control script
- `scripts/setup-nas-keychain.sh` - Keychain credential setup

**Updated:** `.gitignore` - Removed these scripts from ignore list (they contain no passwords, just config)

**Note:** Actual NAS credentials stored in macOS Keychain, NOT in scripts

---

### 3. Added Automatic SSH Key Generation
**Problem:** SSH keys (`id_ed25519_work`, `id_ed25519_personal`) not created during bootstrap

**Solution:**
- Created `setup-helpers/10-setup-ssh-keys.sh` - Non-interactive SSH key generator
- Updated `simple-bootstrap.sh` to include SSH setup as Step 6
- Keys auto-generated using user's Git email from config or work-personal-config.zsh
- SSH config automatically created with work/personal host aliases

**Features:**
- Checks if keys already exist (doesn't overwrite)
- Creates both work and personal keys
- Sets proper permissions (600 for private, 644 for public)
- Creates ~/.ssh/config with GitHub host aliases
- Non-interactive mode for automation

---

### 4. Renamed LaunchAgents: com.user → com.befeast
**Problem:** Inconsistent naming convention across LaunchAgents

**Files Updated:**
- `~/Library/LaunchAgents/*.plist` - Renamed all plist files
- `scripts/nas-mount-control.sh` - Updated PLIST_PATH and LABEL
- `scripts/vaultwarden-setup.zsh` - Updated plist references
- `scripts/vaultwarden-backup-monitor.zsh` - Updated agent name checks
- `scripts/launchagent-*.sh` - Updated example references

**LaunchAgents Now:**
- `com.befeast.mount-nas-volumes`
- `com.befeast.organize-screenshots`
- `com.befeast.vaultwarden-backup`
- `com.befeast.fileorganizer`

**Verified:** ✅ All agents loaded and running

---

## 📦 Updated Bootstrap Process

### simple-bootstrap.sh Changes
Now has **8 steps** (was 7):

1. Install Homebrew
2. Install Oh My Zsh + plugins
3. Deploy shell configuration
4. Create work directory structure
5. Install utility scripts (**now includes NAS scripts**)
6. **NEW: Set up SSH keys automatically**
7. Set up default context
8. Final setup

**Key Improvement:** Clean Mac installations now get:
- All NAS mount scripts
- SSH keys automatically created
- No more "command not found: nas-mount"
- No more manual SSH key generation needed

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### SSH Key Setup Script
**Location:** `setup-helpers/10-setup-ssh-keys.sh`

**Features:**
- Detects existing keys (no overwrite)
- Uses Git config email or work-personal-config.zsh
- Creates ed25519 keys (modern, secure)
- Non-interactive mode with `--non-interactive` flag
- Creates ~/.ssh/config with host aliases
- Sets proper permissions automatically

**Usage:**
```bash
# Automatic (called by bootstrap)
./setup-helpers/10-setup-ssh-keys.sh --non-interactive

# Manual (shows public keys)
./setup-helpers/10-setup-ssh-keys.sh
```

### NAS Scripts Security
**Important:** NAS scripts contain NO passwords
- Usernames and server IPs are in scripts (safe to commit)
- Passwords stored in macOS Keychain via `setup-nas-keychain.sh`
- Keychain accessed at runtime via `security find-generic-password`
- Previous .gitignore entries were overly cautious

## 🧪 Testing Verification

### On This Machine (Working):
- ✅ wdu.sh works on empty directories
- ✅ All 4 befeast LaunchAgents loaded
- ✅ nas-mount alias available
- ✅ SSH keys exist (2 keys)

### Expected on Clean Mac:
After running `bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kossoy/macos-dev-setup/main/install.sh)`:

- ✅ All NAS scripts in `~/work/scripts/`
- ✅ SSH keys auto-created: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work` and `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_personal`
- ✅ wdu command works everywhere
- ✅ nas-mount alias works (after `source ~/.zshrc`)
- ✅ No "command not found" errors

## ⚠️ Important Notes for Next Session

### Project Rules Compliance:
**MUST READ:** `@.claude/prompts/project-rules.md`
**MUST READ:** `@.claude/settings.local.json`

**Critical Rules to Remember:**
1. **Rule 2:** ALL .md files MUST go in `docs/` folder (exceptions: README.md, CLAUDE.md)
2. **Rule 7:** NEVER claim fixes work without running tests first
3. **Context:** This session built on previous NAS/LaunchAgent work

### Security Context:
- NAS scripts contain server IPs and usernames (safe to commit)
- Passwords ONLY in macOS Keychain (never in git)
- SSH keys auto-generated but NOT committed to git
- work-personal-config.zsh contains user-specific settings (gitignored)

### Naming Convention:
- LaunchAgents: `com.befeast.*` (NOT `com.user.*`)
- Scripts: lowercase with hyphens
- Setup helpers: numbered `##-description.sh`

---

## 🔍 Context for Continuation

### Current Architecture:
1. **Bootstrap System**: install.sh → simple-bootstrap.sh → setup-helpers/
2. **Context Switching**: work/personal contexts with Git/browser/database switching
3. **NAS Auto-mount**: LaunchAgent-based with Keychain credential storage
4. **Vaultwarden Backup**: Automated backup system with monitoring
5. **LaunchAgent Management**: Helper scripts for easy agent control

### Recent Evolution:
- Started with basic bootstrap
- Added context switching (work/personal)
- Added NAS auto-mount system
- Added Vaultwarden backup automation
- **This session:** Fixed clean install issues, added SSH automation, renamed agents
