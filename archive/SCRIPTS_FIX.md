# Scripts Fix Summary

**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Issues Fixed**: PATH configuration and symlinks

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Scripts Not in PATH ‚úÖ

**Problem**: `~/work/scripts` wasn't in PATH, so commands only worked with full path.

**Fixed**:
- Updated `~/.config/zsh/paths/paths.zsh`
- Added: `add_to_path "$HOME/work/scripts"`
- Now in PATH before `~/work/bin`

**Test**:
```bash
# Reload shell
source ~/.zshrc

# Verify PATH includes work/scripts
echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n' | grep work/scripts
# Shows: /Users/user123/work/scripts

# Test command works from anywhere
which wdu.sh
# Shows: /Users/user123/work/scripts/wdu.sh
```

### 2. Symlinks Replaced with Actual Files ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Scripts were symlinks to "Mac OS install" folder, preventing deletion of that folder.

**Fixed**:
All 6 symlinks replaced with actual file copies:

```
‚úÖ fix-hostname.sh           (was symlink ‚Üí now actual file)
‚úÖ network-priority.sh       (was symlink ‚Üí now actual file)
‚úÖ organize-screenshots.sh   (was symlink ‚Üí now actual file)
‚úÖ sync-to-branches.sh       (was symlink ‚Üí now actual file)
‚úÖ video-to-audio.sh         (was symlink ‚Üí now actual file)
‚úÖ wdu.sh                    (was symlink ‚Üí now actual file)
```

**Result**: All scripts are self-contained in `~/work/scripts/`

## üéØ Can Now Delete "Mac OS install" Folder

Since all symlinks are replaced:

```bash
# Verify no symlinks remain
ls -la ~/work/scripts/ | grep "^l"
# (should be empty)

# Safe to delete (but keep assets/bin for backup if needed)
# When ready:
# rm -rf ~/work/"Mac OS install"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è About wdu.sh Performance

The `wdu.sh` command shows a progress box then appears to hang. **This is normal!**

### Why It's Slow

```bash
# wdu.sh runs this command:
du -sh * .[!.]*

# This recursively calculates size of EVERYTHING in current directory
# In large folders (like ~/work with many subdirectories), this takes time
```

### Better Usage

```bash
# DON'T run wdu.sh from large directories like ~/ or ~/work
cd ~/work
wdu.sh  # ‚ùå Will take forever (analyzing entire work dir)

# DO run wdu.sh from specific subdirectories
cd ~/Downloads
wdu.sh  # ‚úÖ Fast, shows top 10 items

# Or specify a directory
wdu.sh ~/Downloads  # ‚ùå Doesn't work - needs to be updated

# Or use macOS du directly for quick check
du -sh * | sort -rh | head -10  # Quick alternative
```

### Quick Alternatives

```bash
# Fast disk usage check (only immediate children)
du -d 1 -h ~/work | sort -rh | head -10

# System disk usage
df -h

# Specific folder size
du -sh ~/work/projects

# Find large files
find ~/Downloads -type f -size +100M -exec du -h {} \; | sort -rh
```

## üîß Better wdu.sh Usage

I've created an optimized version:

```bash
# Use the quick version
wdu-quick.sh -n 10 ~/Downloads

# Options:
wdu-quick.sh              # Current directory, top 10
wdu-quick.sh -n 20        # Current directory, top 20
wdu-quick.sh ~/work/docs  # Specific directory
```

## üìã All Available Scripts

After fixes, these work from anywhere:

```bash
# System utilities
wdu.sh                          # Disk usage (run in specific dirs)
wdu-quick.sh <dir>              # Faster version with directory arg
organize-screenshots.sh         # Screenshot organization
video-to-audio.sh <input> <output>  # Video conversion

# Network & system
sudo fix-hostname.sh           # Fix macOS hostname
sudo network-priority.sh       # Network priority management

# Development
sync-to-branches.sh            # Git branch sync
llm-usage.sh [start] [end]    # LLM usage tracking

# Backup & security
vault-backup.sh                # Bitwarden backup
setup-nas-keychain.sh          # NAS keychain setup
mount-nas-volumes.scpt         # Mount NAS volumes
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [x] `~/work/scripts` added to PATH
- [x] All symlinks replaced with actual files
- [x] All scripts executable (`chmod +x`)
- [x] Scripts work from any directory (after `source ~/.zshrc`)
- [x] No dependencies on "Mac OS install" folder
- [x] Created faster wdu-quick.sh alternative

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Reload shell**:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. **Test a command**:
   ```bash
   which wdu.sh
   # Should show: /Users/user123/work/scripts/wdu.sh
   ```

3. **Use scripts properly**:
   ```bash
   # For disk usage, use in specific directories
   cd ~/Downloads
   wdu.sh 5
   
   # Or use the quick version with directory arg
   wdu-quick.sh ~/Downloads
   ```

4. **When ready, delete old folder**:
   ```bash
   # Verify no symlinks
   find ~/work/scripts -type l
   
   # If empty, safe to delete
   # rm -rf ~/work/"Mac OS install"
   ```
