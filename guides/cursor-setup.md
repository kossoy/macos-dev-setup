# Cursor Agent Window vs Editor Window - SOLVED! 🎯

**Issue Discovered:** When Cursor's AI Agent/Composer window is active, opening files from terminal doesn't visibly show them because files open in the editor window **behind** the Agent window.

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed with window-aware functions

---

## 🔍 The Problem

Cursor has **two main window modes**:

1. **Editor Window** - Where you see and edit code files
2. **Agent/Composer Window** - Where you interact with AI (chat, composer, etc.)

When you run `editapi` or similar commands while in **Agent mode**, the file opens correctly but you can't see it because the Agent window stays in front!

---

## ✅ The Solution

Updated all editor functions to:
1. Open the file using `cursor -r` CLI
2. Wait briefly for the file to load
3. Use AppleScript to bring Cursor to front/activate
4. This ensures you see the file even if Agent window was active

---

## 🚀 Updated Commands

All these now work regardless of which Cursor window is active:

```bash
editapi         # Opens api-keys.zsh - now activates window!
editzsh         # Opens .zshrc - now activates window!
editnvim        # Opens nvim config - now activates window!
edit <file>     # Opens any file - now activates window!

# Bonus commands
viapi           # Opens api-keys.zsh in nvim (terminal)
vizsh           # Opens .zshrc in nvim
vinvim          # Opens nvim config in nvim
cursor-editor   # Reminds you of keyboard shortcut to switch views
```

## ⌨️ Cursor Keyboard Shortcuts (Important!)

Learn these to quickly switch between windows:

### View Switching:
- **`Cmd + E`** - Switch to **Editor** view
- **`Cmd + L`** - Open AI Chat in sidebar
- **`Cmd + K`** - Open inline AI composer
- **`Cmd + I`** - Open Composer/Agent (if available)

### File Navigation:
- **`Cmd + P`** - Quick file open (fuzzy search)
- **`Cmd + Shift + P`** - Command palette
- **`Cmd + B`** - Toggle sidebar
- **`Cmd + \`** - Split editor
- **`Cmd + W`** - Close current tab
- **`Cmd + Shift + T`** - Reopen closed tab

### Multiple Windows:
- **`Cmd + Shift + N`** - New Cursor window
- **`Cmd + Tab`** - Switch between Cursor windows (when multiple open)

## 💡 Best Practices

### Method 1: Use Updated Commands (Recommended)
```bash
# In terminal (from any directory)
editapi

# File opens AND Cursor activates automatically
# You'll see the file even if you were in Agent mode
```

### Method 2: Manual Workflow
```bash
# 1. Switch to Editor view in Cursor first
#    Press: Cmd+E

# 2. Then open file
editapi

# File opens in already-visible editor window
```

### Method 3: Keep Editor Window Visible
```bash
# If you use Agent frequently, consider:
# - Opening Cursor in two windows (Cmd+Shift+N)
# - One window for editing, one for Agent
# - Or use Agent in sidebar (Cmd+L) instead of full window
```

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Test 1: While in Agent Window
```bash
# 1. Open Cursor and switch to Agent/Composer view
# 2. In terminal, run:
editapi

# Expected: File opens AND Cursor editor view activates
# You should see api-keys.zsh even though you were in Agent mode
```

### Test 2: While in Editor Window
```bash
# 1. Open Cursor in normal editor view
# 2. In terminal, run:
editzsh

# Expected: File opens immediately and visibly
# Should work perfectly (as it did before)
```

### Test 3: Cursor Not Running
```bash
# 1. Quit Cursor completely
# 2. In terminal, run:
editnvim

# Expected: Cursor starts, file opens, window activates
# Everything works automatically
```

## 🔧 How It Works (Technical)

### Before (Didn't Work with Agent Window):
```bash
editapi() {
    open -a Cursor ~/.config/zsh/api-keys.zsh
}
```
❌ **Problem:** Opens file but doesn't activate/bring to front
❌ **Result:** File hidden behind Agent window

### After (Works with Agent Window):
```bash
editapi() {
    cursor -r "$file" 2>/dev/null       # Open with CLI
    sleep 0.3                            # Brief delay
    osascript -e 'tell application "Cursor" to activate' 2>/dev/null
}
```
✅ **Solution:** Opens file AND explicitly activates Cursor
✅ **Result:** File visible regardless of which window was active

## 📝 Configuration Location

All editor functions are in:
```
~/.config/zsh/functions/functions.zsh
```

Lines 330-395 contain the editor utility functions.

SWITCHING VIEWS:
  Cmd+E               → Editor view
  Cmd+I               → Composer/Agent view
  Cmd+L               → Toggle AI Chat sidebar
  Cmd+K               → Inline AI composer

OPENING FILES FROM TERMINAL:
  editapi             → API keys (window-aware)
  editzsh             → .zshrc (window-aware)
  editnvim            → nvim config (window-aware)
  edit <file>         → Any file (window-aware)
  
  viapi, vizsh, vinvim → Terminal nvim versions

FILE NAVIGATION IN CURSOR:
  Cmd+P               → Quick file open
  Cmd+B               → Toggle sidebar
  Cmd+W               → Close tab
  Cmd+\               → Split editor

MULTIPLE WINDOWS:
  Cmd+Shift+N         → New Cursor window
  Cmd+Tab             → Switch windows
  
PRO TIP:
  Keep Cmd+E handy to quickly jump to editor view!
  Or use Agent in sidebar (Cmd+L) instead of full window.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Open a NEW terminal** (to load updated functions)

2. **Test it:**
   ```bash
   # Open Cursor and go to Agent mode (or don't, either way works now!)
   editapi
   ```

3. **Learn the shortcuts:**
   - `Cmd+E` to switch to editor
   - `Cmd+L` to toggle AI chat sidebar
   - `Cmd+K` for inline AI help

4. **Continue your setup:**
   - Edit api-keys.zsh with the credentials
   - Set up NAS Keychain (if needed)
   - Configure JetBrains Toolbox

**Your Cursor integration now works perfectly with Agent window!** 🎊

The key insight: Files were always opening correctly, they were just hidden behind the Agent window. Now they open AND activate the window, so you always see them!

**Pro Tip:** Learn `Cmd+E` - it's your quick switch to editor view! 🚀
