## File Structure & Naming

### Project Folder Structure

Create a consistent folder structure for all your projects:

```
~/Music/Logic Pro Projects/
├── [Year]/
│   ├── [ProjectName]/
│   │   ├── ProjectName_V1_2025-10-06.logicx
│   │   ├── ProjectName_V2_2025-10-08.logicx
│   │   ├── Audio Files/
│   │   │   ├── Recorded/
│   │   │   ├── Imported/
│   │   │   └── Processed/
│   │   ├── MIDI Files/
│   │   ├── Bounces/
│   │   │   ├── Stems/
│   │   │   ├── Mixes/
│   │   │   └── Masters/
│   │   ├── References/
│   │   ├── Samples/
│   │   └── Notes/
│   │       ├── lyrics.txt
│   │       ├── arrangement.md
│   │       └── mixing-notes.md
```

### Naming Conventions

#### **Project Files:**
```
[ProjectName]_V[Version]_[YYYY-MM-DD].logicx

Examples:
- SummerVibes_V1_2025-10-06.logicx
- ClientDemo_V3_2025-10-08.logicx
- RockBallad_Final_2025-10-10.logicx
```

#### **Bounce Files:**
```
[ProjectName]_[Type]_[Version]_[Date].wav

Examples:
- SummerVibes_Mix_V2_2025-10-06.wav
- SummerVibes_Master_Final_2025-10-08.wav
- SummerVibes_Stem_Drums_V1.wav
- SummerVibes_Stem_Vocals_V1.wav
```

#### **Track Names:**
Use clear, descriptive names:
```
✅ Good:
- Kick In
- Kick Out
- Snare Top
- Lead Vocal Main
- Lead Vocal Harmony 1
- Guitar Rhythm L
- Guitar Rhythm R
- Bass DI
- Bass Amped

❌ Bad:
- Audio 1
- Track 02
- Guitar
- Vox
- New Track
```

### Logic Pro Save Settings

#### **Package vs Folder:**

**Save as Package (.logicx):**
- ✅ Single file - easy to move/share
- ✅ Cleaner desktop/finder view
- ✅ Automatic organization
- ❌ Harder to manually access individual files
- **Recommended for most users**

**Save as Folder:**
- ✅ Easy access to individual files
- ✅ Better for version control with Git
- ✅ Works better with some cloud services
- ❌ Can become messy
- **Recommended for advanced users**

**To change:** Logic Pro > Settings > General > Assets > Save as [Package/Folder]

## Asset Management

### Managing Audio Files

#### **Copy vs. Alias Settings:**

```
Logic Pro > Settings > General > Assets

Recommended Settings:
☑ Copy external audio files to project folder
☑ Copy EXS instruments to project folder
☐ Include assets from global folders
☑ Organize folder by file type
```

**Benefits:**
- Self-contained projects
- Easy to back up
- No missing files when moving projects
- Safe to delete source files after import

#### **Project Audio Settings:**

```
File > Project Settings > Audio

Recommended:
- Sample Rate: 48 kHz (or 44.1 kHz for CD)
- Bit Depth: 24-bit
- Recording Format: WAV (uncompressed)
```

### Cleaning Up Projects

#### **Regular Maintenance:**

```
File > Project Management > Clean Up

Options:
☑ Remove unused audio files
☑ Remove unused samples
☐ Remove unused plugins (careful!)
☐ Empty trash

When to Clean:
- Before final bounce
- When project feels sluggish
- Before archiving
- When running low on disk space
```

**Warning:** Always save a version before cleaning!

### Managing Samples & Loops

```
Folder Structure:
~/Music/Logic Pro Samples/
├── Drums/
│   ├── Kicks/
│   ├── Snares/
│   ├── Hats/
│   └── Loops/
├── Bass/
├── Synths/
├── FX/
└── Vocals/

In Project:
- Keep samples in project folder
- Or maintain a library with consistent structure
- Tag samples in Finder for easy searching
```

## Workflow Tips

### Screensets

Use **Screensets** to switch between different workflow layouts:

```
Create Screensets:
1. Arrange windows for specific task
2. Lock Screenset: choose number (1-9)
3. Switch with number keys

Example Setup:
1 - Recording view (large arrange window)
2 - Editing view (with editors open)
3 - Mixing view (with mixer + plugins)
4 - Master view (with metering)
```

### Key Commands

**Essential Organization Commands:**

```
Track Management:
⌘N - New track
⌘D - Duplicate track
⌃⌘D - Duplicate track & region
Delete - Delete selected track

View:
M - Show/hide mixer
E - Show/hide editor
B - Show/hide Smart Controls
I - Show/hide inspector

Navigation:
; - Next marker

Use Cases:
- Group all drum tracks
- Link stereo guitar pairs
- Control all vocal tracks together
```

### Alternatives & Comping

**Comp Vocal Takes Efficiently:**

```
Workflow:
1. Record multiple takes with cycle mode
2. Each take becomes a take folder
3. Click take folder → Show take lanes
4. Click sections to select best parts
5. Flatten take folder when done

Pro Tip:
- Use Quick Swipe Comping (drag across take folder)
- Color-code your favorite takes
- Save alternatives before flattening
```

## Backup Strategies

### The 3-2-1 Rule

Implement the **3-2-1 backup strategy:**

```
3 - Keep 3 copies of your project
2 - Store on 2 different media types
1 - Keep 1 copy off-site

Example:
1. Working copy: Mac internal SSD
2. Local backup: External SSD/HDD
3. Cloud backup: iCloud/Dropbox/Backblaze
```

### Versioning Strategy

**Incremental Saves:**

```
During Production:
ProjectName_V1_2025-10-06.logicx  (Initial composition)
ProjectName_V2_2025-10-07.logicx  (Added vocals)
ProjectName_V3_2025-10-08.logicx  (Arrangement finalized)

During Mixing:
ProjectName_Mix_V1_2025-10-10.logicx
ProjectName_Mix_V2_2025-10-11.logicx
ProjectName_Mix_Final_2025-10-12.logicx

Important Milestones:
ProjectName_PreMix_Archive.logicx
ProjectName_BeforeClientNotes.logicx
ProjectName_BeforeMastering.logicx
```

**Save As Alternative:**
- ⌘⇧S - File > Save as...
- Increment version number
- Add note about changes

### Time Machine Setup

**Ensure Logic Pro folders are backed up:**

```bash
# Check Time Machine excludes
tmutil isexcluded ~/Music

# Add to Time Machine (if excluded)
# System Settings > General > Time Machine
# Ensure these are NOT excluded:
- ~/Music/Logic Pro Projects/
- ~/Music/Audio Music Apps/
```

### Cloud Backup Options

**Best practices for cloud storage:**

```
✅ DO:
- Save as Package (.logicx) for simpler uploads
- Use selective sync for large projects
- Archive completed projects to cloud
- Keep final masters in cloud

❌ DON'T:
- Work directly from cloud folders (sync issues)
- Upload while project is open
- Trust cloud as your only backup
```

**Recommended Services:**
- **iCloud Drive** - Native integration, but can be slow
- **Dropbox** - Reliable, version history
- **Google Drive** - Generous storage
- **Backblaze** - Continuous backup service

### Project Archiving

**When project is complete:**

```
1. Clean up project (remove unused files)
2. Consolidate project (File > Project Management > Consolidate)
3. Save as final version
4. Bounce all stems
5. Export master
6. Create archive folder structure:

ProjectName_Archive/
├── ProjectName_Final.logicx
├── Bounces/
│   ├── Master/
│   └── Stems/
├── Notes/
└── Reference/

7. Compress to .zip
8. Upload to cloud storage
9. Keep local copy on external drive
```

   - Track > Freeze Track
   - Frees up CPU, maintains audio

2. Reduce buffer size for tracking (lower latency)
   - Logic Pro > Settings > Audio > Devices
   - 64-128 samples for recording

3. Increase buffer size for mixing (more stability)
   - 256-512 samples for mixing

4. Disable plugins on unused tracks

5. Use "Low Latency Mode" when recording
   - Record > Low Latency Mode (⌘L when recording)
```

### Collaboration

**When sharing projects:**

```
1. File > Project Management > Consolidate
